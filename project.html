           Not a formal member of IRIS, but acted as an advisor to club appointed by MINET for this event. As the <strong>Advisor</strong> of this, I helped them with the procurement and establishing the various gadgets used. The gadgets were set-up within two days,
         and test run of the live-stream was done twice before the event. Within the short span of time, te team acquainted itself with OBS or the Open Broadcasting Software which further helped us stream the event smoothly. The team consisted of two photographers from IRIS
       and two advisors from MINET. On the day of the event, we started a chat window and kept record of the viewers, which showed more than 14,000 people from 6 different countries attended the stream, out of which 80% retained till the end. The live-stream was also one of the
     most cost friendly-multi camera live stream throughout NCR.</font></p>
